# Feed Reader Testing

In this project, I am given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The application has incomplete Jasmine test suites, and I write the remaining test suites and get them to pass. The goal is to learn about JavaScript testing, which is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development" or TDD.

## How to Run the Application

A simple way to go is to clone or download this git repository to your local machine. Locate to the repository folder and open index.html, you should be able to see the feeds load.

In this project we use Jasmine.js to write the test suites, feel free to open the `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` to take
a look on the written test suites.
